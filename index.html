<h1> Hello World </h1>
<p> What is the point to living anyway? </p>
<p> All we do in life is just struggle and try to make a living. We make money. We struggle and overcome obstacles or we ignore them. We live then we die. everything we do in life will be forgotten
    in 1 or 2 generations. Nobody will care that we lived at all.
